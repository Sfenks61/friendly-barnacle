# Review a pull request

To
[review a documentation pull request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews):

1. Go to the PR page.

1. Select the **Files changed** tab and read through the documentation changes.

1. View the rendered changes in the [Read the Docs link](../preview/old-system.md#preview-on-read-the-docs) or the
    [GitHub Pages link](../preview/new-system.md#preview-on-github-pages).

1. Evaluate the changes to the best of your ability, including if:

    - The changes are technically accurate.
    - The changes improve your understanding of the subject.
    - The changes make sense in the context they're in.
    - You're not left with any confusion or questions about the subject of the changes.
    - The changes follow the [writing style guidelines](style-guide.md) and the
      [markdown guidelines](markdown/configure-and-format.md#format-markdown-for-documentation).

1. In the **Files changed** tab, hover over any line you want to comment on to the right of the line number, and select
    the plus sign (+).
    You can also select multiple lines at once.
    Add your comment, or select the file symbol to make a specific suggestion.
    Select **Start a review**, and repeat for any other comments or suggestions.

1. When you're done commenting, select **Finish your review** in the upper right corner, and select:

    - **Comment** if you have comments or suggestions you want the PR author to consider.
    - **Approve** if you think the PR is OK to merge.
    - **Request changes** if you require the author to make changes.
      Selecting this option requires you to re-review the PR later before the author can merge it.

1. Submit your review.
