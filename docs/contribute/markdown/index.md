# MkDocs and Markdown guide

ConsenSys documentation is written using [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax.
The pages in this section explain the Markdown tools, configuration, standards, and custom extensions used.

!!! important

    We are currently in the process of migrating documentation sites that use the
    [old system](../../overview/index.md#old-documentation-system) to the
    [new system](../../overview/index.md#new-documentation-system).

    All sites support the [Markdown extensions](extensions.md).
    Sites that use the new system also support [macros](macros.md) and [pluglets](pluglets.md).

    See the [full list of features introduced by the new system](../../overview/new-features.md).
