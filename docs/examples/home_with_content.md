# ConsenSys NFT

ConsenSys NFT is a powerful engine for managing your NFT drops and secondary transactions with a
feature rich API.
ConsenSys NFT eliminates the frustrations of dealing with smart contracts and allows you to mint,
list, display, and collect royalties and payments securely from non-fungible and semi-fungible
assets, using just a few API calls.

ConsenSys NFT stores all the media files the metadata of your tokens on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), a
fully decentralized and immutable storage network.
This means no single entity including ConsenSys NFT or the NFT creator can change the content once
the smart contract is deployed.
Every token minted is automatically _pinned_ on an IPFS node such that it will never be lost.
Learn about how IPFS keeps your NFT immutable and permanent through
[content addressing](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/mint-nfts-with-ipfs/#how-ipfs-helps).

ConsenSys NFT currently supports **ERC-721** and **ERC-1155** asset standards on **Rinkeby**,
**Mainnet**, and **Polygon**.

The platform supports:

- Custom design of token metadata via Item Types.
- Sending NFTs via email.
- Custom split of fees and royalties.
- Multiple ways to sell your NFTs.
- Webhooks to subscribe to events from ConsenSys NFT.
